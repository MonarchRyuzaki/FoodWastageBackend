[ ] Change role application logic to keep status as "pending" instead of auto-approving.
    - Reason: Avoid bypassing admin review process.
    - File: controllers/auth.js (or wherever it's located)
    - Reminder: Update frontend to reflect "pending" status flow before changing.
    - Priority: Medium

[ ] Send email upon role application to inform user:
    - Message: “Your application is under review. You’ll be notified once it’s approved/rejected.”
    - Can use existing email utility (email.js or similar)
    - Add after status is set to "pending"
    - Priority: Low (can wait until the status flow is changed)
